# IRIS Vector Search - Early Access Program

Welcome to the Early Access Program (EAP) for IRIS Vector Search! This program provides participants with the tools and knowledge to leverage the power of vector search within InterSystems IRIS.

## Getting Started

- **Overview**: IRIS Vector Search introduces SQL-based vector capabilities, enabling powerful semantic search functionalities within your applications.
  - This functionality in IRIS 2024.1 is Experimental, and will be fully released in a future IRIS release.
  - IRIS Vector Search comprises a new SQL datatype _vector_, and similarity functions to search for similar vectors using _cosine_ and _dot product_ comparison.
  - Users can access this functionality via SQL directly, or via Community-developed and LangChain and LlamaIndex, popular Python frameworks for developing Generative AI applications.
- **Early Access Materials**:
  - Clone this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/intersystems-community/iris-vector-search) for instructions and code to use InterSystems IRIS Community Edition via docker, as well as demo applications.
  - If you would like to install a "bare metal" kit that is not the Community Edition, please contact [Thomas Dyar](mailto:thomas.dyar@intersystems.com).

## Documentation and Demos

- IRIS Vector Search is officially released in IRIS 2024.1, documentation here: https://docs.intersystems.com/iris20241/csp/docbook/Doc.View.cls?KEY=GSQL_vecsearch
- Tutorials, and demo files, available at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/intersystems-community/iris-vector-search).
